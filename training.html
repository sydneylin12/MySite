    <h1>Training</h1>
    <p>One of my true passions is helping others, whether it be through academic help or personal
      training. I am a certified trainer with the ISSA, and I work at the University of Minnesota
      Recreation and Wellness Center. I truly enjoy going to work every day and working with my motivated
      clients. It's a privileg to be able to help others become fit, and I hope that I can change a life as much as
      my first training buddy/partner did for me. Below, you'll find a bit of information on how training has worked for me.</p>

    <h1>The Golden Rule of Muscle Growth</h1>
    <p>Contrary to popular belief, muscle gain isn't as hard as you might think. There are no special tricks, supplements,
      eating habits, and so on. Bodybuilders will meticulously tweak their diet and exercise, but normal people trying to
      get fit don't need to think too hard about building muscle. The single MOST important factor of training is:
    </p>
    <p><b><u>Progressive Overload</u></b></p>
    <p>This is just a different way of saying "lift more over time." Muscle growth is essentially forced
      adaptation of your body to external stimuli - or resistance training, in this case. Lifting weights causes
      muscle damage, which will cause your body to perform better than it did pre-training, given the proper amount
      of recovery; this is called <b>supercompensation</b>. Based on these "golden rules," any type of training
      can be classified into a simple cycle:</p>
    <p><b>Train Properly > Recover Enough > Repeat</b></p>
  </div>

  <!-- <div class="box">
    <h1>Training Properly</h1>
    <p>You've seen it before: tons of people are in the gym for 2+ hours and their clothes are soaked. Unfortunately, they're
    doing something wrong. Time spent in the gym does <b>not</b> have a direct relationship with muscle gain. In fact, too much
    exercise can inhibit your progress. A proper resistance training session takes at most an hour and a half.</p>
